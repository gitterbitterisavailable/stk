<p><strong>====================================</strong></p>
<h5>First and foremost, I am not an Anti-Vaxxer. Many sources have been 
talking about a vaccination that is supposed to solve everyone's 
problems. The fact is, society at large does not have a Covid-19 health 
risk. Nobody requires a vaccination for Covid-19. Moderna and Pfizer are
 heavily advertising a radical new vaccine technology of altering the 
patients RNA. This mRNA technology is a completely experimental vaccine.
 Nobody knows the long term effects of altering a persons RNA to respond
 to a certain virus. This also violates the <a href="https://www.globalresearch.ca/who-cdc-new-nuremberg-trials-2021-crimes-against-humanity_/5744609" rel="nofollow noopener" title="This link will take you away from hive.blog">Nuremberg Codes</a>,
 by making an experimental vaccine mandatory through Coercion, 
Lockdowns, Duress and Threats to force people to take this vaccine or be
 Prohibited to Participate in Free society under the Mandate of a 
Vaccine Passport or Green Pass. Below I have a list of Evidence Based 
and Scientific Studies on Covid-19 that will dispel the nonsense and 
misinformation by those that are aggressively pushing for Covid 
vaccinations, mandatory mask wearing, in support of lockdowns etc., Be 
aware of several Fake Fact Check Websites with a negative bias towards 
anyone that questions Covid-19 and the experimental mRNA technology.</h5>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The decision as to which test protocols

Eurosurveillance. A decision to recognise the errors apparent in the

The <a href="https://www.wnd.com/2021/01/now-admits-gold-standard-covid-test-unreliable/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="This link will take you away from hive.blog">WHO</a> also confirms that the PCR Covid test is unreliable. In this <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download" rel="nofollow noopener" title="This link will take you away from hive.blog">CDC Document</a>,on
 page 39, testing guidelines state that false negatives and positives 
are possible. And on page 40, the PCR test cannot rule out diseases 
caused by other bacterial or viral pathogens...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On page 42, SARS-CoV-2 was never isolated in the first instance: “No 
quantified virus isolates of the 2019-nCoV were available for CDC use at
 the time the test was developed and this study conducted, assays 
designed for detection of the 2019-nCoV RNA were tested with

<p><strong>More Information.</strong> Therapeutics and prophylactics for
 coronaviruses, like Hydroxychloroquine, have been approved and can be 
viewed on the WHO, CDC and NIH websites. But, for some reason, in 2020 
they were banned. Why? Because, according to FDA rules only when there 
are no alternative therapeutics, can untested vaccines be cleared for <a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/emergency-use-authorization-vaccines-explained" rel="nofollow noopener" title="This link will take you away from hive.blog">Emergency Use Authorization</a>....</p>

<li><strong>A new review suggests that a possible unintended 
consequences of mRNA based COVID-19 vaccines by Moderna and Pfizer, may 
lead to unexpected neurological conditions similar to Mad Cow Disease.</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Experimental mRNA vaccines have been heralded as having the potential for great benefits, but <strong>they also harbor the possibility of potentially tragic and even catastrophic unforeseen consequences.</strong>
 The mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been implemented with great 
fanfare, but there are many aspects of their widespread utilization that
 merit concern.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Public policy around mass vaccination has generally proceeded on the 
assumption that the risk/benefit ratio for the novel mRNA vaccines is a 
“slam dunk.” With the massive vaccination campaign well under way in 
response to the declared international emergency of COVID-19, <strong>we have rushed into vaccine experiments on a world-wide scale.</strong>
 At the very least, we should take advantage of the data that are 
available from these experiments to learn more about this new and 
previously untested technology. And, <strong>in the future, we urge governments to proceed with more caution in the face of new biotechnologies.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally, as an obvious but <strong>tragically ignored suggestion</strong>, the <strong>government should also be encouraging the population to take safe and affordable steps to boost their immune systems naturally</strong>,
 such as getting out in the sunlight to raise vitamin D levels (Ali, 
2020), and eating mainly organic whole foods rather than chemical-laden 
processed foods (Rico-Campà et al., 2019). Also, eating foods that are 
good sources of vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin K2 should be 
encouraged, as deficiencies in these vitamins are linked to bad outcomes
 from COVID-19 (Goddek, 2020; Sarohan, 2020).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The vaccines used against COVID were not
 only submitted to insufficient clinical testing, but that the quality 
of the active substances, their “excipients, some of which are new,” and
 the manufacturing processes are problematic. Everyone has the right to 
clear, fair and appropriate information. This information is also 
permanent: in the event of new data being revealed, people who have 
already been vaccinated must be informed a posteriori (after the 
administration of a particular vaccine). The vaccine “obligation” cannot
 therefore flourish  ; even in disguised form, notably via a 
“vaccination passport” .....</p>

 - I am extremely concerned that this "vaccine" is being promoted to the
 point of coercion to the general population as "safe and effective". 
People are not being informed adequately about the status of EUA and the
 concerns of many experts about the mRNA technology. The events reported
 in VAERS should be of great concern. Reports of myocarditis in the 
young, including the increased incidence reported in Israel, are also 
very worrisome. This vaccine, if offered at all, should be given only to
 adults at high risk of COVID, only voluntarily, and only with full 
disclosure of information.</p>

 - I’ve had the same dizziness and nausea every time I’m around a 
vaccinated person. It started in January when my aunt who was vaccinated
 visited the same day. I got a full body rash &amp; severe body aches 
for days after consoling her while she cried after my uncle died (not 
vaccine related). I’ve also had irregular periods since then. The first 
one was for almost two weeks then I got two periods a month for two 
months. It’s so unbearable that I ask everyone the vaccine status before
 seeing them. I’ve begun to feel like a metal (vaccinated) detector. I’m
 also nursing a toddler &amp; did throughout the ordeal. He developed a 
minor cold like illness with no fever &amp; an unproductive cough; 
general malaise. I really hope the real science gets done &amp; there 
are no lasting effects for myself or by young son. I am also trying for 
another baby.</p>

with a feeling of anxiety and prevents sleep. I worry about ALS and 
other serious diseases, but wonder if this could be vaccine related. I

 burning neuropathy in both feet followed by fasciculations in arms and

feet and ankles and muscles in legs hurt.</strong> He had EMG which showed benign fasciculation syndrome. Nothing benign about it. <strong>He is miserable.</strong>
 I believe the vaccine caused this but he also had COVID the first week

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Quote:</strong> “In support of this hypothesis, we found <strong>chimeric transcripts consisting of viral fused to cellular sequences</strong> in published data sets of SARS-CoV-2 infected cultured cells <strong>and primary cells of patients</strong>, consistent with the <strong>transcription of viral sequences integrated into the genome</strong>. To experimentally corroborate the possibility of viral retro-integration, we describe evidence that <strong>SARS-CoV-2 RNAs can be reverse transcribed in human cells by reverse transcriptase (RT) from LINE-1 elements or by HIV-1 RT</strong>, and that these <strong>DNA sequences can be integrated into the cell genome and subsequently be transcribed</strong>. Human <strong>endogenous LINE-1 expression was induced upon SARS-CoV-2 infection or by cytokine exposure in cultured cells</strong>,
 suggesting a molecular mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 retro-integration in 
patients. This novel feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection may explain why 
patients can continue to produce viral RNA after recovery and suggests a
 new aspect of RNA virus replication.”</p>

<p><strong>Conclusions:</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>He has grave concerns about the lack of transparency of side 
effects, censoring of discussion and the lack of informed consent that 
these bring.</li>
<li>Free SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is biologically active — contrary to 
initial assumptions — and causes severe problems. It is responsible for 
the most severe effects seen in COVID-19, such as bleeding disorders, 
blood clots throughout the body and heart problems. These are the same 
problems we now see in a staggering number of people who have received 
the COVID-19 “vaccine”.</li>
<li>The spike protein also has reproductive toxicity, and Pfizer’s 
biodistribution data show it accumulates in women’s ovaries. Data 
suggests the miscarriage rate among women who get the COVID “vaccine” 
within the first 20 weeks of pregnancy is 82%.</li>
<li>Israeli data show boys and men between the ages of 16 and 24 who 
have been vaccinated have 25 times the rate of myocarditis (heart 
inflammation) than normal.</li>
<li>The COVID-19 injections have emergency use authorization only, which
 can only be granted if there are no safe and effective remedies 
available. Such remedies do exist, but have been actively censored and 
suppressed.</li>

least 1,000,000 more. And we’re only halfway to the finish line. We need
 to PAUSE these vaccines NOW before more people are killed.</li>
<li>Based on what I now know about the miniscule vaccine benefits 
(approximately a 0.3% reduction in absolute risk), side effects 
(including death), current COVID rates, and the success rate of early 
treatment protocols, the answer I would give today to anyone asking me 
for advice as to whether to take any of the current vaccines would be, 
‘Just say NO.’</li>
<li>The current vaccines are particularly contraindicated if you have 
already been infected with COVID or are under age 20. For these people, I
 would say ‘NO! NO! NO!’</li>
<li>In this article, I will explain what I have learned since I was 
vaccinated that totally changed my mind. You will learn how these 
vaccines work and the shortcuts that led to the mistakes that were made.</li>
<li>You will understand why there are so many side effects and why these
 are so varied and why they usually happen within 30 days of 
vaccination. You will understand why kids are having heart issues (for 
which there is no treatment), and temporarily losing their sight, and 
ability to talk. You will understand why as many as 3% may be severely 
disabled by the vaccine.”</li>

<p><strong>Areas Covered</strong> Using 18 NIH studies and more than 50 other technical references, this paper defines<br>
several different ways the COVID-19 virus attacks our body and how it responds. It also<br>
describes how the 17 comorbidity conditions defined by the CDC are involved in nearly<br>
all deaths. We also discuss some serious contradictions involving Big Pharma and<br>
political decisions, along with why we believe vaccines are not the answer to this<br>
pandemic.</p>

hope they will dig into the areas we did not have time to pursue because we think it<br>
should cause every person on the planet to question every politician, scientific journal<br>
and Big Pharma. To do otherwise is to NOT “follow the science.”</p>

 from person to person through respiratory droplets. Once inside the 
body the virus will invade our cells and reproduce itself. In response 
to the virus our immune system will attack the invader launching first a
 response from T-cells designed to kill the cells infected with the 
virus and later an antibody response designed to kill the virus before 
it gets into another cell.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Discussion</strong> Most of the complaints reported by 
children can be understood as consequences of Discussion carbon dioxide 
levels in inhaled air. This is because of the dead-space volume of the 
masks, which collects exhaled carbon dioxide quickly after a short time.
 This carbon dioxide mixes with fresh air and elevates the carbon 
dioxide content of inhaled air under the mask, and this was more 
pronounced in this study for younger children.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This leads in turn to impairments attributable to hypercapnia. A 
recent review6 concluded that there was ample evidence for adverse 
effects of wearing such masks.</p>

<h3><strong>29|</strong> FDA Classifies mRNA as Gene Therapy!</h3>

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Page 70</strong> Currently, mRNA is considered a <strong>gene therapy</strong>
 product by the FDA. Unlike certain gene therapies that irreversibly 
alter cell DNA and could act as a source of side effects, mRNA-based 
medicines are designed to not irreversibly change cell DNA; however, 
side effects observed in gene therapy could negatively impact the 
perception of mRNA medicines despite the differences in mechanism.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Adverse events in clinical trials of our investigational medicines or
 in clinical trials of others developing similar products and the 
resulting publicity, as well as any other adverse events in the field of
 <strong>mRNA medicine</strong>, or other products that are perceived to be similar to <strong>mRNA medicines</strong>, such as those related to <strong>gene therapy or gene editing</strong>, could result in a decrease in the perceived benefit of one or more of our programs.......</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There have been few approvals of gene therapy products in the United 
States or foreign jurisdictions, and there have been well-reported 
significant adverse events associated with their testing and use. Gene 
therapy products have the effect of introducing new DNA and potentially 
irreversibly changing the DNA in a cell. In contrast, mRNA is highly 
unlikely to localize to the nucleus, integrate into the DNA, or 
otherwise make any permanent changes to cell DNA.........</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For instance, a clinical hold on <strong>gene therapy</strong> 
products across the field due to risks associated with altering cell DNA
 irreversibly may apply to our mRNA investigational medicines 
irrespective of the mechanistic differences between <strong>gene therapies and mRNA</strong>.<br>
Adverse events reported with respect to gene therapies or genome editing
 therapies could adversely impact one or more of our programs.</p>

<p><strong>Robert W Malone, MD, MS</strong><br>
I provide this brief essay for the TrialSite community because you are 
involved or at least interested in human subject clinical research. By 
way of background, please understand that <strong>I am a vaccine 
specialist and advocate, as well as the original inventor of the mRNA 
vaccine (and DNA vaccine) core platform technology.</strong> But I also 
have extensive training in bioethics from the University of Maryland, 
Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, and Harvard Medical School, and 
advanced clinical development and regulatory affairs are core 
competencies for me.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong> 1) An unlicensed medical product deployed
 under emergency use authorization (EUA) remains an experimental product
 under clinical research development. 2) EUA authorized by national 
authorities basically grants a short-term right to administer the 
research product to human subjects without written informed consent. 3) 
The Geneva Convention, the Helsinki declaration, and the entire 
structure which supports ethical human subjects research requires that 
research subjects be fully informed of risks and must consent to 
participation without coercion. Has that bright line been crossed? If 
so, what actions are to be taken? I look forward to learning from your 
thoughts and conclusions.</p>
